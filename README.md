# TOP-file-uploader
A stripped down file uploader for The Odin Project practice with Prisma

This app is currently hosted on Koyeb (while it is in development only).

[ ] if a file is to be accessed and checked if it is shared, we must also go 'up the tree' to see if any parent is shared
[ ] create a menu with the option to change the user's name or password
[ ] maybe also allow them to change their email address but that would require that they type in a special code that you sent them (which would expire in 5 minutes?)

[ ] figure out the routes for CRUD on files
[ ] figure the route for sharing a folder or a file and cancelling that share
[ ] test koyeb deployment
