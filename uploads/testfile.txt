
Feature: Drill down from seeing the inventory of an item to view the inventory by item+price combination
Feature: Display average price of item in case it helps set the new price as people buy or stock prices change
Feature: Display the inventory by category (drill down to see each item and drill further to see item prices and amounts per group)

Feature: CRUD for all categories and brands and items
Feature: password check before deleting a category or an item or a brand
Feature: delete category or brand will delete all items that associate with that, so we need some query to run first before we delete for real
